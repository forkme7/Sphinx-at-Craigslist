Sphinx at Craigslist
====================

This is a mirror of the [public read-only Sphinx code
repository](http://code.google.com/p/sphinxsearch/source/checkout), merged with whatever patches and changes we may be using at Craigslist.

You're free to use this code tree, but there's really no warranty or support.  It's mainly here so that people interested in our changes (mostly the Sphinx developers, I expect) can see what we're doing.

This a list of the changes committed so far:

  * [prefork config](http://github.com/jzawodn/Sphinx-at-Craigslist/commit/877adab38e671578b242a83e772dbb2105510723) enables you to specify how many pre-fork searchd processes to start (this functionality was reomved a while back for some reason)
